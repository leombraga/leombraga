Hey there, I'm Leonardo and, after a two-year break from studying coding due to work, I'm back on track and reviewing the basics of logic and algorithm. My intentions are to develop
my skills with python as soon as I finish learning the basics. For the moment, I am solely focused on studying and, in the future, I do plan to find an internship of a job at the IT
field. Currently I work as an English teacher at a public school and will start a new college degree this semestrer. 

Pronouns: he/him.

Hobbies: reading, playing video games, studying languages (mostly English and Mandarin).
